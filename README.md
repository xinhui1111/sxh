# Simulation-of-a-VANET-in-MATLAB

Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) is based on V2V communications between vehicles and V2I communications between vehicles and road-side infrastructure. Vehicular mobility is a major challenge in VANET design. This project provides you with basic insights into vehicular mobility and how it impacts VANET network density and V2V/V2I connectivity.

This project has two parts:

In the first part, you will find simulation of one type of vehicular mobility—freeway mobility—to assess network densities available for V2V connectivity under different road traffic volumes. 

In the second part, you will find simulation of an elemental graphical tool that visualizes and assesses two types of user-specified VANET scenarios: (i) V2V communications at a four-way street intersection; (ii) V2I communications between a vehicle and deployed RSUs.
